# Infrastructure Task Force

We encourage contributions meeting the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).  While we prefer the creation of issues and Pull Requests in the GitHub repository, discussions often occur on the [public-credentials](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/) mailing list as well.

Co-chairs:
- Wayne Chang, Spruce Systems, Inc.
